# FantasyBaseballComp

Collect baseball stats from over the years to compare to the different scoring formats I've used.
CBS, ESPN, and Ottoneu 

Play out 2 seasons of Fantasy and see how the standings would have played out in comparison to the scoring in place.

Compare the scoring to WAR rankings to find which one whos the truely the best players.

WAR: WAR measures a player's value in all facets of the game by deciphering how many more wins he's worth than a replacement-level player at his same position (e.g., a Minor League replacement or a readily available fill-in free agent).
